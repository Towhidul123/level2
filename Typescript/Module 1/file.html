Q. What is typescript

Typescript is an Object Oriented Programming language that is built on top of JS with EXtra Features.

Q. Why use typescript instead of JS?

Javascript doesn't type check i.e a variable can be anything like it can be string or in that same variable can be be
number/array/object/function. So in a large scale project it becomes difficult to do a project with javascript as in the
longrun with multiple developers working in the same project errors with these variables occurs more often. Also in
typescript any eslint can be run.
